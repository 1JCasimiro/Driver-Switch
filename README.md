# Driver-Switch

* THIS SOFTWARE DOES NOT WORK WITHOUT SETTING IT UP FIRST				                                
												                       
       This program makes it simple to change your tablet drivers, everytime you switch tablet brands.
												                   
HOW TO SETUP
												  
\\\ Everytime that you install a new brand driver, it overrides the wintab32.dll file in the System32 folder.
\\\ Location of wintab32.dll file: C:\Windows\System32.
											                        
- Download your tablet 1 drivers and save the wintab32.dll on the brand 1 folder;
- Download your tablet 2 drivers and save the wintab32.dll on the brand 2 folder;
- Do the same to other brands if you own any;
															
INSTRUCTIONS TO USE AFTER SETUP
															
1 - Run Driver Switch.exe and write the name of the brand you want to use.
															
\\\ EXTRA - If you have another brand or more than one config .dll file, you can make a new folder and use the
name of that folder as a command in prompt.
												                        
OBS: If it doesnt work right away, reboot the computer.
