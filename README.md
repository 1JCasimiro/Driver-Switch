# Driver-Switch

<p>Have you ever wondered why you can't use two different brands of drawing tablets on the same computer(Windows)?</p><br>
The reason is because they both use the same file to save your drivers configuration.

This program makes it simple to change your tablet drivers, everytime you switch tablet brands.

<h2>THIS SOFTWARE DOES NOT WORK WITHOUT SETTING IT UP FIRST</h2>				       										      

<h3>HOW TO SETUP</h3>
												  
Everytime that you install a new brand driver, it overrides the wintab32.dll file in the System32 folder.<br>
Location of wintab32.dll file: C:\Windows\System32.
										                        
- Download your tablet 1 drivers and save the wintab32.dll on the brand 1 folder;
- Download your tablet 2 drivers and save the wintab32.dll on the brand 2 folder;
- Do the same to other brands if you own any;
															
<h2>INSTRUCTIONS TO USE AFTER SETUP</h2>
															
1 - Run Driver Switch.exe and write the name of the brand you want to use.
															
<b>EXTRA:</b> If you have another brand or more than one config .dll file, you can make a new folder and use the
name of that folder as a command in prompt.
												                        
<b>OBS:</b> If it doesnt work right away, reboot your computer.
